# Smart Desk with Ergonomic Control and Posture Monitoring

This project monitors your sitting posture using sensors and machine learning. If you sit incorrectly for more than 5 minutes, a buzzer will alert you to correct it.

# Features
- Uses MPU6050 and FSR sensors
- Classifies posture as good or bad using a Random Forest ML model
- Sends alert if poor posture is detected for 5 minutes
- Accuracy: 97%

# Technologies Used
- Arduino Uno
- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- VS Code
- Arduino IDE
